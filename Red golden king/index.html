            <p>
                Im basically a web developer.
                Not professional though. Still I have
                skills, skills needed for a 13 year old.
                Yeah, Iam 13 and I know python and html. 
                By the way, current date is 2025 lol. 
                This is my first web that I created myself.
                So I guess thats it.
